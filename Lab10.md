## Task 6.1:  How to provide your services through a REST API?
As we have seen in previous lab sessions, we can have plots in Python using libraries such as matplotlib.  However, how to provide our results through an API to consumers?

If you want to use Python to build a prototype server (of your service) and you want to provide web-based API with minimal effort, you can take advantage of the web app that we have previously developed and deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

As a simplistic and quick implementation example, we are going to create a new view "chart" that will provide the service of visualizing how many e-mails we have gathered in our web app. Consequently, when a "client" invokes the URL *http://127.0.0.1:8000/chart*, we will provide them a chart with our results.

In your web app, you can have as many URLs as necessary. Such URLs receive parameters and produce results in different formats: Images, XML, JSON, etc.

If you are interested in building a "real REST server", there are many excellent Python frameworks for building a RESTful API: [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [Falcon](http://falconframework.org/), [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html) and even [Django REST framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) that follows the Django framework that we are now using.

We have different options to create the visualization. However, we suggest using [D3.js](https://d3js.org) because it plays very well with web standards such as CSS and SVG, and allows creating some fantastic interactive visualizations on the web. Many people who work in data science think that it is one of the coolest libraries for data visualization.

[D3.js](https://d3js.org) is, as the name suggests, based on Javascript. We will present a simple option to offer data D3 visualization with Python using the Python library [Vincent](https://github.com/wrobstory/vincent), that bridges the gap between a Python back-end and a front-end that supports D3.js visualization. Vincent takes our data in Python format and translates it into [Vega](https://github.com/vega/vega), a JSON-based visualization grammar that will be used on top of D3.

First, we need to install Vincent:

```
(eb-virt)_$ pip install vincent
```

Then, we add a new view at *form/urls.py*.

```python
urlpatterns = [
    # ex: /
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
    # ex: /signup
    path('signup', views.signup, name='signup'),
    # ex: /search
    path('search', views.search, name='search'),
    # ex: /chart
    path('chart', views.chart, name='chart'),
]
```

We will add the following lines at the end of the file *form/views.py* *(you can alter the following code with the solution that you implemented for the optional part of Lab. session #5)*:

```python
import os
import vincent
from django.conf import settings

BASE_DIR = getattr(settings, "BASE_DIR", None)


def chart(request):
    domain = request.GET.get('domain')
    preview = request.GET.get('preview')
    leads = Leads()
    items = leads.get_leads(domain, preview)
    domain_count = Counter()
    domain_count.update([item['email'].split('@')[1] for item in items])
    domain_freq = domain_count.most_common(15)
    if len(domain_freq) == 0:
        return HttpResponse('No items to show', status=200)
    labels, freq = zip(*domain_freq)
    data = {'data': freq, 'x': labels}
    bar = vincent.Bar(data, iter_idx='x')
    filename = 'domain_freq.json'
    bar.to_json(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static', filename))
    return render(request, 'chart.html', {'filename': filename})
```

At this point, the file `domain_freq.json` is written as *static/domain_freq.json* inside the project's directory. The JSON file contains a description of the plot that can be handed over to D3.js and Vega.


To visualize the plot you can save at *form/templates/chart.html* a simple template (taken from [Vincent resources](https://github.com/wrobstory/vincent)).

```html
{% load static %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Vega Scaffold</title>
    <script src="http://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    <script src="http://d3js.org/topojson.v1.min.js"></script>
    <script src="http://d3js.org/d3.geo.projection.v0.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
    <script src="http://trifacta.github.com/vega/vega.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<div id="vis"></div>
</body>
<script type="text/javascript">
    // parse a spec and create a visualization view
    function parse(spec) {
        vg.parse.spec(spec, function (chart) {
            chart({el: "#vis"}).update();
        });
    }
    parse('{% static filename %}');
</script>
</html>
```

Now you can open your browser at http://localhost:8000/chart and obtain access to the chart in SVG format.

<p align="center"><img src="./images/Lab10-1.png " alt="Chart" title="Chart"/></p>

With the above procedure, we can plot many different types of charts using `Vincent`. [Explore Vincent by yourself](http://vincent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Now you know how to deploy your services/web apps on the cloud using Elastic Beanstalk. Elastic Beanstalk, as you have already experimented, is an orchestration service that automatically builds your EC2, auto-scaling groups, ELB's, Cloudwatch metrics and S3 buckets so that you can focus on just deploying applications to AWS and not worry about infrastructure tasks.

If you check the code for the controller "chart", you will see that it accepts the same parameters that search admitted. Therefore you can have different plots based on the parameters: *http://127.0.0.1:8000/chart?preview=Yes&domain=upc.edu*

Having the data to feed Vega written as static content is not the best way to distribute it because different clients can invoke different parameters simultaneously and plots from different requests will be mixed offering unwanted results.

**Q61a: Think how you can use S3 to solve the problem. Write the changes in the code and explain your solution.**

To solve some appearing issues you may want to read [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html).

**Q61b: Once you have your solution implemented publish the changes to Elastic beanstalk and try the new functionality in the cloud. Did you need to change anything, apart from the code, to make the web app work?**

Write your answers in the `README.md` file for this session.

## Task 6.2: How to provide our service combined with third-party services?

To augment the value of our service, we can build it upon other services. As an example of combining our service with third-party services, I suggest to plotting tweets on a map. For this purpose, we will use [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org), a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures and [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com), a Javascript library for interactive maps.

**GeoJSON** supports a variety of geometric types of formats that can be used to visualize the desired shapes onto a map. A GeoJSON object can represent a geometry, feature, or collection of features. Geometries only contain the information about the shape; its examples include Point, LineString, Polygon, and more complex shapes. Features extend this concept as they contain a geometry plus additional (custom) properties. Finally, a collection of features is just a list of features. A GeoJSON data structure is always a JSON object. The following snippet shows an example (taken from https://github.com/bonzanini/Book-SocialMediaMiningPython) of GeoJSON that represents a collection with two different points, each point used to pin a particular city:

```json
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
          -0.12
          51.5
        ]
      },
      "properties": {
        "name": "London"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
          -74,
          40.71
        ]
      },
      "properties": {
        "name": "New York City"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In this GeoJSON instance, the first key is the `type` of the represented object. This field is
mandatory and its value must be one of the following:
* `Point`: This is used to represent a single position
* `MultiPoint`: This represents multiple positions
* `LineString`: This specifies a string of lines that go through two or more positions
* `MultiLineString`: This is equivalent to multiple strings of lines
* `Polygon`: This represents a closed string of lines, that is, the first and the last positions are the same
* `GeometryCollection`: This is a list of different geometries
* `Feature`: This is one of the preceding items (excluding GeometryCollection) with additional custom properties
* `FeatureCollection`: This is used to represent a list of features

Given that `type` in the preceding example has the `FeatureCollection` value, we will expect the `features` field to be a list of objects (each of which is a `Feature`).

The two features shown in the example are simple points, so in both cases, the
`coordinates` field is an array of two elements: longitude and latitude. This field also
allows for a third element to be there, representing altitude (when omitted, the altitude is
assumed to be zero).

For our example, we just need the smallest structure: a `Point` identified by its coordinates (latitude and longitude). To generate this GeoJSON data structure we only need to iterate all the tweets looking for the coordinates field.

Twitter allows its users to provide their geolocation when they publish a tweet, in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates. With this information, we are ready to create some friendly visualization for our data as interactive maps. Unfortunately, the details about the geographic localization of the user's device are available in only in a small portion of tweets: many users disable this functionality on their mobile.

Let us create a listener program, *TwitterListener.py*, based on the code we made in previous lab sessions. We are going to execute the following code and let it listen to tweets. If the tweet contains geo localization we save it in our new NoSQL table `twitter-geo`.

```python
from tweepy import OAuthHandler
from tweepy import Stream
from tweepy.streaming import StreamListener
from dateutil.parser import parse
import json
import sys
import os
import boto3

GEO_TABLE = 'twitter-geo'
AWS_REGION = 'eu-west-1'

class MyListener(StreamListener):

    def __init__(self):
        dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb', region_name=AWS_REGION)
        try:
            self.table = dynamodb.Table(GEO_TABLE)
        except Exception as e:
            print('\nError connecting to database table: ' + (e.fmt if hasattr(e, 'fmt') else '') + ','.join(e.args))
            sys.exit(-1)

    def on_data(self, data):
        tweet = json.loads(data)
        if not tweet['coordinates']:
            sys.stdout.write('.')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            return True
        try:
            response = self.table.put_item(
                Item={
                    'id': tweet['id_str'],
                    'c0': str(tweet['coordinates']['coordinates'][0]),
                    'c1': str(tweet['coordinates']['coordinates'][1]),
                    'text': tweet['text'],
                    "created_at": parse(tweet['created_at']).isoformat(),
                }
            )
        except Exception as e:
            print('\nError adding item to database: ' + (e.fmt if hasattr(e, 'fmt') else '') + ','.join(e.args))
        else:
            status = response['ResponseMetadata']['HTTPStatusCode']
            if status == 200:
                sys.stdout.write('x')
                sys.stdout.flush()

    def on_error(self, status):
        print('status:%d' % status)
        return True

consumer_key = os.environ['CONSUMER_KEY']
consumer_secret = os.environ['CONSUMER_SECRET']
access_token = os.environ['ACCESS_TOKEN']
access_secret = os.environ['ACCESS_SECRET']

auth = OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_secret)

twitter_stream = Stream(auth, MyListener())
twitter_stream.filter(locations=[-2.5756, 39.0147, 5.5982, 43.957])
```

In the above program have used a different way of filtering tweets: a geo bonding box. You can [select your favorite geo bounding box](http://boundingbox.klokantech.com/) using a web app made by [Klokan Technologies](https://www.klokantech.com/): choose CSV format, draw your bounding box, copy the coordinates and start listening.

<p align="center"><img src="./images/Lab10-BoundingBox.png" alt="Bounding box for Barcelona Area" title="Bounding box for Barcelona Area"/></p>

Going back to our dear Django web app, we will add a new view 'map'.

```python
urlpatterns = [
...
    # ex: /map
    path('map', views.map, name='map'),
]
```

The controller for the new view uses *get_tweets()* to scan *'twitter-geo'* and *map()* builds the GeoJSON file to plot the tweets. Edit the file *form/views.py* and paste the following Python code at the end.

```python
from .models import Tweets
import json

def map(request):
    geo_data = {
        "type": "FeatureCollection",
        "features": []
    }
    tweets = Tweets()
    for tweet in tweets.get_tweets():
        geo_json_feature = {
            "type": "Feature",
            "geometry": {
                "type": "Point",
                "coordinates": [tweet['c0'], tweet['c1']]
            },
            "properties": {
                "text": tweet['text'],
                "created_at": tweet['created_at']
            }
        }
        geo_data['features'].append(geo_json_feature)

    if geo_data['features']:
        filename = 'geo_data.json'
        with open(os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static', filename), 'w') as fout:
            fout.write(json.dumps(geo_data, indent=4))
        return render(request, 'map.html', {'filename': filename})
    else:
        return HttpResponse('No items to show', status=200)
```

At the *form/models.py* file we will add a new model with the function *get_tweets*. Create this model based on the code for the model Leads().

```python
class Tweets(models.Model):

    def get_tweets(self):
        #
        # Add your code here to return the 'tweets' stored in your new dynamoDB table
        #
        logger.error('Unknown error retrieving tweets from database.')
        return None
```

Now, using the Leaflet.js Javascript library for interactive maps, we can create our `.html` view containing the map. Copy the contents of this file at *forms/templates/map.html*

```html
{% load static %}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Quick Start - Leaflet</title>

    <style>
        #map {
            height: 600px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
<!-- this goes in the <body> -->
<div id="map"></div>
<script>
    // Load the tile images from OpenStreetMap
    var mytiles = L.tileLayer('http://{s}.tile.osm.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
        attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://osm.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
    });
    // Initialise an empty map
    var map = L.map('map');
    // Read the GeoJSON data with jQuery, and create a circleMarker element for each tweet
    $.getJSON("{%  static filename %}", function (data) {
        var myStyle = {
            radius: 2,
            fillColor: "red",
            color: "red",
            weight: 1,
            opacity: 1,
            fillOpacity: 1
        };
        var geojson = L.geoJson(data, {
            pointToLayer: function (feature, latlng) {
                return L.circleMarker(latlng, myStyle);
            }
        });
        geojson.addTo(map)
    });
    map.addLayer(mytiles).setView([40.5, 5.0], 6);
</script>
</body>
</html>
```
Just execute the web app locally http://127.0.0.1:8000/map, and you will see something like:

<p align="center"><img src="./images/Lab10-map1.png" alt="Tweets in Barcelona City" title="Tweets in Barcelona City"/></p>

<p align="center"><img src="./images/Lab10-map2.png" alt="Tweets in Europe" title="Tweets in Europe"/></p>

Now we are showing all the collected tweets on the map. Can you think of a way of restricting the tweets plotted using some constraints? For instance, the user could invoke http://127.0.0.1:8000/map?from=2020-02-01&to=2020-02-03. You can add other functionality that you think it could be interesting for the users.


**Q62a: Implement map using restriction parameters.** Change the code to implement the new feature and explain what you have done and show the results in the *README.md* file for this lab session.

If several users request the same time frame you can think of storing the JSON file to avoid recalculating it. Make the necessary changes to save a file on S3 with the following name 20200201_20200203.json to save the above request.

**Q62b: Publish your changes to Elastic beanstalk and explain what changes have you made to have this new function working.**

**Q62c: How would you run `TwitterListener.py` in the cloud instead of locally? Try to implement your solution and explain what problems have you found and what solutions have you implemented.**
